        <img src = "Fossil Fuels.jpg" alt = "Human activity on Climate Change" width = "500" height = "300" class="centre">
        <p> Humans are a major cause of climate change, due to activities and results that we are seeing in the world. These include:
        <br>- Burning fossil fuels
        <br>- Increased Greenhouse Gas Emissions which have led to rising temperatures
        <br>- Rising sea levels
        <br>- More frequent and more intense drought
        <br>- Shrinking mountain glaciers
        </p>

        <img src = "carbonfootprint.jpg" alt = "How to help the planet" width = "500" height = "300" class="centre">
        <p>We can play our own part as individuals in helping to reduce the effects of climate change on the areas that we live in. Ways in which we can do this include:
            <br>- Eating less meat and dairy
            <br>- Flying less
            <br>- Walking instead of using cars for short journeys
            <br>- Reducing energy use e.g. turn off lights in your home when you do not need to use them
